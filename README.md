# WallaMarvel iOS Technical Test Implementation

## Overview

This Marvel heroes app demonstrates modern iOS development practices with clean architecture, robust error handling, and excellent user experience. The implementation showcases a scalable approach suitable for production applications.

## Architecture & Design Decisions

### Clean Architecture with MVP Pattern
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between Data, Domain, and Presentation layers
- **MVP Implementation**: Presenter handles business logic, View manages UI state, Model represents data
- **Dependency Injection**: Uses Factory library for loose coupling and testability
- **Protocol-Oriented**: Interfaces define contracts between layers for flexibility

### Modern Swift Concurrency
- **async/await**: Complete migration from completion handlers for cleaner, more maintainable code
- **Structured Concurrency**: Proper task management with cancellation support
- **Actor Model**: Thread-safe state management where needed
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient network failures

### State Management Strategy
- **SwiftUI + ObservableObject**: Reactive UI updates with `@Published` properties
- **Single Source of Truth**: `ListHeroesUIStore` centralizes UI state
- **Debounced Search**: Prevents excessive API calls during user typing
- **Pagination State**: Tracks loading states for smooth infinite scroll

### Error Handling Philosophy
- **Typed Errors**: Specific error types for different failure scenarios
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Technical errors translated to actionable user feedback
- **Graceful Degradation**: App remains functional even when some features fail
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatic retries for transient failures, manual retry for permanent ones

### Performance Optimizations
- **Image Caching**: URL caching configured for efficient image loading
- **Pagination**: Load data incrementally to reduce initial load time
- **Prefetching**: Anticipate user scrolling to preload content
- **Debouncing**: Reduce API calls during rapid user input

## Features Implemented

### 1. Hero List with Search & Pagination
- **Infinite Scroll**: Automatic loading of additional heroes when approaching list end
- **Debounced Search**: 350ms delay prevents excessive API calls while typing
- **Loading States**: Different indicators for initial load, pagination, and search
- **Error Recovery**: Retry options when requests fail

### 2. Hero Detail View
- **Progressive Image Loading**: Low-resolution to high-resolution image transitions
- **Comprehensive Information**: Name, description, and related content counts
- **Expandable Sections**: Comics, series, stories, and events with "show more" functionality
- **Smooth Navigation**: Natural flow between list and detail screens

### 3. Robust Network Layer
- **Authentication**: Marvel API hash-based authentication with timestamp
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for 5xx errors and transient network issues
- **Request Cancellation**: Prevents unnecessary network calls during rapid user actions
- **Timeout Handling**: 30-second timeouts with appropriate error messaging

### 4. Accessibility & User Experience
- **VoiceOver Support**: Proper accessibility labels and hints
- **Dynamic Type**: Supports user font size preferences
- **Loading Feedback**: Clear indicators for all loading states
- **Error Messages**: Contextual, actionable error information

### 5. Testing Infrastructure
- **Dependency Injection**: Easy mocking for unit tests
- **UI Test Support**: Mock data provider for consistent UI testing
- **Protocol-Based Design**: Testable components with clear interfaces
- **Structured Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Layer
- **API Client**: `APIClient` handles all network requests with async/await
- **Authentication**: Timestamp-based hash generation for Marvel API
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with jitter for transient errors
- **Timeouts**: 30-second timeout with cancellation support
- **Caching**: URL caching configured for efficient image loading

### Presentation Layer
- **MVP Pattern**: `ListHeroesPresenter` handles business logic
- **UI Store**: `ListHeroesUIStore` manages UI state with debounced search
- **SwiftUI Views**: `HeroListView` and `HeroDetailView` for declarative UI
- **Navigation**: SwiftUI NavigationStack for smooth transitions

### State Management
- **ObservableObject**: `ListHeroesUIStore` for reactive UI updates
- **Debounced Search**: 350ms delay prevents excessive API calls
- **Pagination State**: Tracks loading states for smooth infinite scroll

### Error Handling
- **Typed Errors**: Specific error types for different failure scenarios
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Technical errors translated to actionable user feedback
- **Graceful Degradation**: App remains functional even when some features fail
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatic retries for transient failures, manual retry for permanent ones

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure all Swift files are added to your Xcode project.
2. Project uses SwiftUI and Factory for DI. Add `Factory` via Swift Package Manager.
3. Marvel API keys are configured via `Info.plist`:
   - `MARVEL_PUBLIC_KEY`
   - `MARVEL_PRIVATE_KEY`

## Marvel API Notes

If you encounter issues with the Marvel API:
- Ensure API keys are configured in `Info.plist`.
- API client retries transient errors automatically.
- Error handling shows user-friendly messages with retry option.

## Final Notes

This implementation demonstrates modern iOS development practices including:
- Swift Concurrency (async/await)
- MVP with SwiftUI state store
- Proper error handling and retry logic
- Pagination and search with debounce
- Responsive, accessible UI
- Dependency injection with `Factory`
- Image loading with smooth transitions
- Structured logging for better observability
